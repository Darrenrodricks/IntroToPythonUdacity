# Functions 

* In this chapter, I learned how to create my own functions and learned how they work within a module. All of the code that is associated with this chapter deals with functions built-in to python or basic ones I wrote to comlplete a challenge
* Programs such as ["Cities"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdacity/blob/main/Functions/CitiesProject.py) and ["LambdaIntro"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdacity/blob/main/Functions/LambdaIntro.py) were very simple and easy to learn.
